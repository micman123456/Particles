# Particle Physics Simulation

This project is a particle-based physics simulation written in C++. It simulates particle movement, collision, and physics-based interactions such as velocity, acceleration, and 2D elastic collisions between particles. The simulation also includes features like boundary collision and customizable properties for each particle, such as size, color, and velocity constraints.

## Features

- **Particle Spawning**: Spawn particles at random positions, sizes, and colors.
- **Two-Dimensional Collision Handling**: Calculate accurate collision responses for particles with unique masses and velocities.
- **Velocity and Acceleration**: Manage particle movement using velocity and acceleration, with support for maximum velocity limits.
- **Boundary Collisions**: Particles interact with boundary walls, allowing for realistic containment.
- **Customizable Particles**: Particles can have varying colors, sizes, velocities, and acceleration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this simulation, you need:

- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- A development environment like Visual Studio Code or CLion (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/particle-physics-simulation.git
   cd particle-physics-simulation
